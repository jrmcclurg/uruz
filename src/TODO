1. The flattening needs to generate the correct eq_ and str_ code for each expanded thing (maybe fixed?)
2. Fix the comments stripping
3. CodeBlock -> ('{' .. '}') : Code   { Code(get_current_pos (),$1) } ;
   doesnt work for some reason!
4. When there's no code block on a Pattern, put in a default one!
