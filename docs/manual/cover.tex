\vspace{0.15in}
When developing programming languages, it is very important
to get the syntax just right.  This involves first making a
parser, and then adjusting the parser through many iterations
as the language's grammar changes and evolves through the
development.  Each time this happens, both the parser and
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) data structures and manipulation
functionality needs to change.  This process can become very
tiresome, and can take time away from development of the
language's functionality.  Thus, we have built the Parser
Generator Generator (PGG) system to automate this unnecessary
attention to the language syntax.  PGG takes a high-level
grammar specification, in an expressive EBNF form, and
produces the corresponding OCaml lexer/parser scripts, as
well as AST data structures and manipulation functions.  The
tool can also emit the necessary skeleton code to allow
PGG to be integrated into the build for the project.  This
allows for projects where the entire lexing/parsing/AST
frontend is specified in a highly-readable EBNF form.
