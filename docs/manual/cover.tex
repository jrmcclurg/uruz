\vspace{0.15in}
Designing a Domain Specific Language (DSL) can be quite tedious,
with large amounts of time and effort spent building successive
iterations of the lexer and parser as the language evolves
throughout the development process.
Each time a syntactical change is made, both the lexer/parser and
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) data structures and manipulation
functions may change.  This process can become very
time-consuming, and can distract from development of the
language's functionality.  Thus, we have built the Parser
Generator Generator (PGG) system to abstract away this unnecessary
attention to the frontend implementation details.  PGG takes a high-level
grammar specification in an expressive Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF),
and produces the corresponding OCaml lexer/parser scripts, as
well as AST data structures and manipulation functions.  The
tool can also emit the necessary skeleton code to allow
PGG to be integrated into the build for the project.  This
allows for projects where the entire lexing/parsing/AST
frontend is specified in a highly-readable EBNF form,
and allows DSL developers to quickly get a prototype up and running.
